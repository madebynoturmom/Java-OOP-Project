# Java OOP Project

## Overview

This project is designed to help you understand and implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The project is structured into different folders, each containing systems that exemplify OOP concepts. While these systems may not be perfect, they provide a solid foundation for developing your skills and can be a great starting point for your own projects.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into several folders, each representing a different system or component built using OOP principles. Hereâ€™s an overview of what each folder contains:

- **Event Management System**
- **Library Management System**
- **Restaurant Management System**

(Replace the placeholder text with the actual descriptions of each system.)

## OOP Principles Demonstrated

Each system in this project demonstrates key OOP principles, including:

- **Encapsulation**: Data is hidden within classes, and access is controlled via public methods.
- **Abstraction**: Complex systems are simplified using abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Inheritance**: Code reuse is achieved through the use of inheritance, where child classes inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Different classes can be treated as instances of the same parent class, allowing for flexible and dynamic code.
